[X] Render goal form
[X] Support submitting goal form
[ ] Show ID next to goal

[ ] When constructing input field, define parser (make special piece of model state for inputs)

[X] Calculate stat for how much is required for a goal to be on track
[ ] Calculate percentage for how on track goal is (i.e. done-up-to-now / required-up-to-now * 100) - capped to 100%
